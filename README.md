# Defective Pump Impeller Detection Using a CNN

This repository contains the files of my project for the Artificial Intelligence
course at Tehran Polytechnic.

## Project Description

This project is basically a classification problem. Since we are dealing with
images, we have decided to solve it with a convolutional neural network due to
its abilities in image processing.

## Dataset

The data we used are available on
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ravirajsinh45/real-life-industrial-dataset-of-casting-product).

## More Details

To find more details, see [`notebook.ipynb`](./notebook.ipynb).

## Results

Our CNN model can classify images of pump impeller with an accuracy of **~96%**.
